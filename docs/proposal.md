Idea #1: An app that can help people make the correct response in an emergency. Once the app is open it has a few options on what kind of emergency is taking place (Fire, Injury, Weather, Allergic Reaction, Shooting, ETC.). The app will ask questions that can be answered simply and quicky to help the responder take the correct next steps to proceeding safely. This could be calling first responders. Directing them to a safe area, Or contacting other users of the app to come and help. The app can also track location on campus to show an evacuation plan or to the closest weather safe area in the bulding. The app should be easy to access for all users that are either attending the school or that are visiting for possible events. The app would use some type of decision tree choices narrowing down the correct response as the user progresses through questions. Its would need to be efficient at finding the correct response without being to vaugue with questions that the reponse wont help, Or so specific that you will never find a response. 

Idea #2: A location based social media app similar to YikYak that is anonymous posts. Users will have accounts that can interact and post freely on the app. Users can post text, photos, and videos as well as interact with other users around them. They can interact with others posts through text comments or picters/gifs. You wil see only posts from users in the desired range and may even join communities that are close to you. There could even be events on the app where the app will give a location in the area for everyone to go and make a post at.
