Project Idea:
Webapp for Hanover College that can help people make the correct response in an emergency. You will start out by picking what location you are at on campus. Once the app is open and the location is entered the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is shown and it has a few options on what kind of emergency is taking place. The app will ask questions that can be answered simply and quicky to help the responder take the correct next steps to proceeding safely. This could be calling first responders. Directing them to a safe area, Or simply showing them the correct EAP for their location. The app should be easy to access for all users that are either attending the school or that are visiting for possible events. THsi will be scanning QR codes located in multiple areas of each location that takes them to the correct page of webapp. The webapp would use some type of decision tree choices narrowing down the correct response as the user progresses through questions. Its would need to be efficient at finding the correct response without being to vaugue with questions that the reponse wont help, Or so specific that you will never find a response. 

Similar Software:
There are many different applications that can give you your GPS location and show you information on where you are located. Something like google maps does this showing you nearby attractions, gas stations, stores, or almost anything else you may be looking for. What most apps like this seem to lack is how to react or where to go if there is an emergency. There are apps that are alert systems for emergencies or you can even call emergency services if it is severe enough. What Im looking for is somrthing that can provide all of these uses into one easy to navigate app that everyone can access. I want this app to know what location you are at so it can guide you as best and quickly as possible to navigate through any emergency if needed. Whether it tracks your GPS location or you can pick from a list of close by locations it can quickly provide you with the best possible actions. 

Framework Choice:
Im looking for this app to be able to be used on both IOS and Android. React Native is a framework that can use one code base for multiple different platforms. I am already familiar with React and JavaScript so this will allow me to have more time creating and planning out the app rather than spendin time trying to learn a new framework. React Native has a very helpful documentation page as well as multiple free tutorials to help get me started. There are also many built-in Core Components that are ready to be used. Compared to Flutter I think React Native has more libriaries and better components that I am familiar with. I have experience with the languages Cordova uses but I will still have to do some learning on the framework. With my prior experience with React it is the better framework for me to use for creating this app.
