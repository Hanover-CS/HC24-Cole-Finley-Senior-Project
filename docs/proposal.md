Idea #1: An app that can help people make the correct response in an emergency. Once the app is open it has a few options on what kind of emergency is taking place (Fire, Injury, Weather, Allergic Reaction, Shooting, ETC.). The app will ask questions that can be answered simply and quicky to help the responder take the correct next steps to proceeding safely. This could be calling first responders. Directing them to a safe area, Or contacting other users of the app to come and help. The app can also track location on campus to show an evacuation plan or to the closest weather safe area in the bulding. The app should be easy to access for all users that are either attending the school or that are visiting for possible events. The app would use some type of decision tree choices narrowing down the correct response as the user progresses through questions. Its would need to be efficient at finding the correct response without being to vaugue with questions that the reponse wont help, Or so specific that you will never find a response. 

React Native uses React and JavaScript for making mobile apps. I am already familiar witht these so this will help the learning curve significantly when using React Native.
