Idea #1: An app that can help people make the correct response in an emergency. Once the app is open it has a few options on what kind of emergency is taking place (Fire, Injury, Weather, Allegic Reaction, Shooting, ETC.). The app will ask questions that can be answered simply and quicky to help the responder take the correct next steps to proceeding safely. This could be calling first responders. Directing them to a safe area, Or contacting other users of the app to come and help.
