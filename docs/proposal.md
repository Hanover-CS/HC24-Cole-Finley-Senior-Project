Idea #1: An app that can help people make the correct response in an emergency. Once the app is open it has a few options on what kind of emergency is taking place (Fire, Injury, Weather, Allergic Reaction, Shooting, ETC.). The app will ask questions that can be answered simply and quicky to help the responder take the correct next steps to proceeding safely. This could be calling first responders. Directing them to a safe area, Or contacting other users of the app to come and help. The app can also track location on campus to show an evacuation plan or to the closest weather safe area in the bulding. The app should be easy to access for all users that are either attending the school or that are visiting for possible events. The app would use some type of decision tree choices narrowing down the correct response as the user progresses through questions. Its would need to be efficient at finding the correct response without being to vaugue with questions that the reponse wont help, Or so specific that you will never find a response. 

Im looking for this app to be able to be used on both IOS and Android. React Native is a framework for making mobile apps that can be used on multiple different platforms. I am already familiar with React and JavaScript so this will allow me to have more time creating and planning out the app rather than spendin time trying to learn a new framework. React Native has a very helpful documentation page as well as multiple free tutorials to help get me started. There are also many built-in Core Components that are ready to be used. Compared to Flutter I think React Native has more libriaries and better components that I am familiar with. I have experience with the languages Cordova uses but I will still have to do some learning on the framework. With my prior experience with React it is the better fraework for me to use for creating this app.
