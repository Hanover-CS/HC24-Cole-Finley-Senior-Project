Flutter is a framework that is used to develop cross-platform native mobile applications. Flutter is from google so it uses the programming language Dart and provides SDK I am unfamiliar with Dart so I will have to learn a new language to use Flutter. Flutter gets rid of the maintenance problem of having to have two codebases when trying to release an app to two different platforms. Flutter is the #1 framework for developing mobile apps.

React Native uses React and JavaScript for making mobile apps. I am already familiar with these so this will help the learning curve significantly when using React Native. I have started a working on a seperate project using React and have watched two tutorials on it so i think it woill be the easiest to continue to use.

Cordova is another cross-platform framework that is owned by Adobe. It uses HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. I am a little bit familiar with these languages so  the learning curve will be less than learning FLutter but stilll harder than React Native.
